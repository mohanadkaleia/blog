In this post I will explore what is the effect and how to handle missing values when studying the correlation between two variables or set of data.

Before going through in this post, I will explain little bit about the correlation. When two set or variables are linked together we say the two variables are correlated.

First thing to know, to calculate the correlation between two variables, they must be in the same size.

When we have missing values from one variable that means in this empty there is no relationship, so we have two options to handle this situation:

1.  Impute missing data with values, and here we have to decide how to do the imputation.
2.  Remove or delete the same portion of the second signal that has missing values in the first variable

There is a trade between the two solution, first if the number missing values is small enough, we can do imputation easily (e.g. we can take the average between the missing value). But, if the missing values are large enough, we can't do efficient imputation, but in the same time cut a big portion of the signal will have a bad effect and may lead to give bad correlation value!
