Hi :)

Google maps is one of the most famous API for developer to work with maps. I worked on several projects in the intelligent transportation systems domain, analysis traffic data. Dealing with Google maps was one of essential things. Sometimes, I had to quickly plot points on the maps that reflect specific segments on highways, for that reason I developed a very simple tool to plot markers on the map based on Latitude and Longitude data. I like to make it open source and available so anyone can work on it on fly.

Oops, forgot to say, the tool is implemented based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You really don't need to install anything, find it on my website:
