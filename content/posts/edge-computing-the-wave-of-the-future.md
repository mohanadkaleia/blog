[**Cloud computing** was the wave of the future, or maybe it is the current wave of these days but not for the future anymore. Internet of things become to be on the top of the hype cycle of emerging technologies \[1\], and by **2020** around **50 billion** devices will be connected to the internet sensing environment, as a result a really huge data (around **40ZB**) will be generated, yes big data era is coming, but to handle all of coming data in the real time, process and generate knowledge out of it would really consider a crucial and yet hard to be handled ]{style="font-size:14px;"}[on]{style="font-size:14px;"}[ current data centers. So the question here how to get ]{style="font-size:14px;"}[benefit]{style="font-size:14px;"}[ of these data with losing its value?]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[A new term called **edge processing** is coming up along with internet of things, where data will be processed not in the cloud but early at the edge of the network where the connection between things and the internet is taking place, or what we call the gateway. But how to make the edge computing possible, billions of connected devices mean billion of gateways, a cheap and yet powerful processing units is required to do so. To handle this issue a lot of handy solutions are coming up with very promising capabilities (and cheap enough), examples are **Raspberry PI** as a whole computer, **Intel Edison** as a ]{style="font-size:14px;"}[compute]{style="font-size:14px;"}[ module, also our phones can be considered a on the edge of the network to do preprocessing on the data coming from sensors.]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[Cloud based]{style="font-size:14px;"}[ computing is still necessary to store, process and get knowledge out of **IoT** data, but having edge computing will reduce the huge amount of processing power / storage needed to handle all of the IoT data in the cloud.]{style="font-size:14px;"}
