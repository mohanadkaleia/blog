Wordpress is so powerful CMS system with a very good suport service, but some times you really stuck with a bug or unpredictable error, few days ago  I faced an error with my blog is when I submit a post I got 404 error page, and my post not saved!!, I searched a lot for an hours and finally I found the solution that worked for me.

FIrst let me explain the reason of this problem, it is because of permalinks of posts, just give a try and from Settings \> Permalinks set permalins to defalt and try to update your post or something, the problem should be fixed!! But we custom permalinks is so usefull especially for SEO so what is the sollution.
