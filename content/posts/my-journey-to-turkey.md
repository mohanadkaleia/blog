If you have the choice to live in a different era, what era would you choose?ti When I‚Äôve been asked this question, the first answer I got is now.. I won‚Äôt travel back in time to any different era and the reason is GPS for navigation. I suck in navigation, it is very easy for me to get lost. Today, I‚Äôm gonna talk about how not to get lost when you travel to a foreign country. 

Five years ago, I traveled to a Turkey, and I lived there for a whole year. Before traveling into there, I had this urge and temptation that I need to learn some Turkish.. maybe few sentences to help me communicating with people, but then I was like yeah.. I ‚Äôm pretty sure people there can understand and speak little English. So, did not really learn that much Turkish. The first moment I arrived there I needed to ask about the direction and that was the shock, it was so hard to find anyone speaking English. and I barely was able to take a Taxi to go to the main destination. The first lesson I learned was don‚Äôt make an assumption about people ability to understand other languages. 

I got into the Taxi, he started driving and we agreed on how much he will take a head of time before we start the journey he asked for 15 Lira. I was like yeah I have lots of money in my pocket. The moment we arrived, and I gave him his money, he started complaining, and remember I still don‚Äôt understand the language. I was like why he is complaining, like dude you got your 15 lira.. what do you want. Then I figured that I gave him like 15 cents comparing to USD. The second lesson, learn about the currency before you go. Also, at that moment I figured that I don‚Äôt have lots of money in my pocket, and I need to exchange some USD to Turkish Lira.

Learning about the currency, is not enough though, when buying stuff lets say from the grocery store you will need to know numbers at least from 1 to 100, so when you pay you would know how to count and calculate. Otherwise you will end up like me.. I just used to give the cashier a large bill so he will do the calculation and give me the change.

Now, the best thing of all is to have a smart phone with internet and GPS enabled. This will be your best friend when exploring new places or even new cities. It was not the case for me though, I had a dump phone, no internet, no GPS, and even no camera. Whenever I needed to go to a new place, I had to make a plan ahead. Writing down the whole trip planning, every direction, how many blocks, signs, validate and check with too many people, even Google maps was not that great.. (yeah Google maps does not perform well in all countries). One day, I had to pickup a friend from the port from a different city, I prepared a solid plan, I was like yeah I won‚Äôt need to ask anyone. I ended up in the middle of no where. I was so lucky that a nice guy driving a big truck full of water melon saw me and picked me up.. I sit literally on a pile of water melon.. but he was an angle to me saving my life. The lesson I learned here, having a GPS with smartphone is a blessing, but if you don‚Äôt have one don‚Äôt fear to ask people out for direction. Especially if you suck in navigation like me. 

Those are my personal lessons and tips that I learned when traveling to a foreign country. First, try to learn primitive words and never make the assumptions about the people ability to understand English. Learn about the currency and have some cash and change with you ahead of time, it is not always available to exchange USD with other currencies. In addition to learning about the local currency, learning numbers is a must. And finally, try your best to have smart phone with you with internet connection, this will save you bunch of effort, beside of that don‚Äôt be afraid of asking people for direction in case you got lost even if it is hard to communicate, it is fun believe me üòÑ
