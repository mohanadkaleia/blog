[Hello friends, ]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[One of the basic algorithms that any developer or engineer can face during his \\ her working (researching) is to find the shortest path between two points. There are so many algorithms to find the shortest path between two points, actually Google using such an algorithm with its "Maps" app to find the shortest (best) path between two points on the map. ]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[Recently I was playing against a bot in "]{style="font-size:14px;"}[fightcode]{style="font-size:14px;"}[" website, I faced a problem to find the shortest path between two points on a square grid, where each point can be located on a line of the grid, as shown in the figure above.]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[By taking an example of two points, for `departure = [0.4, 1]` and `destination = [0.9, 3]`, the output should be `2.7`.]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[So .. how we can find the BEST solution to get the shortest path, and when I say the best I mean to come out with implementable algorithm to solve this problem, ]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[Lets]{style="font-size:14px;"}[ get started! ]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[First lets think of it, what cases we might face to travel between two points on a grid, in general we can have the following cases:]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[[Steps:]{.underline}]{style="color:#800080;"}  {#steps dir="ltr"}
----------------------------------------------

[[1.]{style="font-size:26px;"}]{style="color:#008000;"} [Find the closest points fro both departure point and destination point, like in the following diagram:![Drawing (2)](http://mycodee.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Drawing-2-300x160.png){.aligncenter .size-medium .wp-image-657 width="300" height="160"}]{style="font-size:14px;"}

[2. Calculate the distance between each points and its neighbors, for example: the point (0.4, 1) has two neighbor points {(1,1) , (0,1)}, so the distance between the actual point and the first point (1, 1) is **0.6**, and the distance to the second point is **0.4**]{style="font-size:14px;"}

3\. Calculate the distance matrix, by calculating the possible distance between the all 4 points
