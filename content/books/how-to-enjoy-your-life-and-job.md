I can say this is 101 book of how to deal and communicate with people in order to ease and build a successful realationship with. I enjoyed the examples covered in this book, some of them are repetitive. But overall a nice book to read. Note, there is a lot of similarities between this book and another book for the same author called "How to win friends and influence people" so don't get both :)
